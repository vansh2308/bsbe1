      <div class="content">So the first question that comes to mind is that what is protein? Proteins are large, complex molecules that play many critical roles in the body. They do most of the work in cells and are required for the structure, function, and regulation of the body’s tissues and organs. Proteins are made up of hundreds or thousands of smaller units called amino acids, which are attached to one another in long chains. There are 20 different types of amino acids that can be combined to make a protein. The sequence of amino acids determines each protein’s unique 3-dimensional structure and its specific function. Amino acids are coded by combinations of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides), determined by the sequence of genes.

      <div class="content" style="margin-top: 2vh;">Protein structure is the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in an amino acid-chain molecule. The function of a protein is highly dependent on its 3D structure. The amino acid sequence of a polypeptide chain determines the final 3D structure of the protein. There are four levels of protein structure; the primary structure, the secondary structure, the tertiary structure, and the quaternary structure. Furthermore, there are two main classes of 3D protein structures; these are globular and fibrous proteins. Complex, 3D proteins are produced by folding of the simple primary and secondary protein structures.

      <div class="lb" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: 700;">What is Structure Alignment ?</div>
      <div class="content" style="margin-top: 2vh;">Structure alignment attempts to establish residue-residue correspondence between two or more macromolecular structures based on the optimal superposition of their shape and three-dimensional conformation. Structure alignment requires no prior knowledge of equivalent pairs of residues, does not rely on the sequence alignment, and the type of residues is ignored when the correspondence is established. This tool presents options for pair wise structure alignment of proteins. In the case of pair wise alignment, structures are always compared in pairs.

      <div class="lb" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: 700;">When is Structure Alignment useful?</div>
      <div class="content" style="margin-top: 2vh;">Structure alignment is a valuable tool for the comparison of proteins with low structure similarity, where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard structure alignment techniques. Pair wise protein structure comparison can be used for analysis of conformational changes on ligand binding, analysis of structural variation between proteins within an evolutionary family, and identification of common structural domains. <br>
      There are many ways by which you can perform Protein Structure Alignment like MM align, TM align, Dali, Kpax, etc. Each of them use different algorithms to align the structures and some are constrained to particular type of structures like TM align only compare the tertiary proteins. So based on your type of structural proteins you can use these tools mentioned above.
